# Minecraft-Skin-Getter-PythonVer
###Transplant from [Minecraft-Skin-Getter](https://github.com/layou233/Minecraft-Skin-Getter)
Some standard runtime libraries of Python are used in this project.</br>
I won't maintain it until Mojang updates their API. But if you have any questions about it, please put them on Issues!
